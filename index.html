        <h1>Cooking Catfish Pepper Soup</h1>
        <p class="description">
          Catfish pepper soup is a light, spicy Nigerian soup that celebrates
          the clean, rich flavour of catfish with aromatic “pepper soup” spices,
          hot peppers and fresh herbs.
          <br />
          It’s served piping hot with boiled yams, plantain, rice, or by itself
          as a restorative dish.
          <br />
          This comforting soup is often enjoyed as a warming meal, especially
          during cold weather or festive gatherings.

      <!--Step by step instructions on how to cook catfish pepper soup-->
      <section class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Wash the catfish with lime (important):</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Rinse the fish under cold running water. Cut into steaks if not
              already done.
            </li>

            <li>
              Cut 1–2 limes in half and squeeze the juice over each piece, then
              rub the lime over the skin and inside the cavity. The acid helps
              remove the slimy coat and reduce strong “fishy” odour. Let the
              lime sit 1–2 minutes, then rinse thoroughly under running water.
              <br />
              Pat pieces dry with paper towel. (If the fish is very slimy, you
              can add a small pinch of coarse salt while rubbing before
              rinsing.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Prep aromatics and spice:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Blend or finely chop half the onion together with the Scotch
              bonnet peppers (for a smoother broth you can blend, for a clearer
              soup use chopped peppers). Reserve sliced onion for garnish.
            </li>

            <li>
              Measure pepper soup spice (or mix your ground spices). If using
              crayfish, have it ready.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Build the broth:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In a large pot, pour 5–6 cups of water and bring to a boil. Add
              the pepper soup spice, half the blended onion (or whole onion
              halves if you prefer), seasoning cubes, and a pinch of salt. Let
              the spice simmer for 4–6 minutes so the flavours bloom.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Add the catfish carefully:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reduce heat to medium-low (gentle simmer). Gently add the catfish
              pieces to the broth. Cover and simmer 8–12 minutes — catfish cooks
              quickly; avoid vigorous stirring so the fish doesn’t break up.
              Check for doneness: flesh should flake easily and be opaque.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Add fresh pepper/onion and finish:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you reserved blended pepper, you can add it now (or earlier for
              a hotter, cloudier soup). Add ground crayfish (if using). Taste
              and adjust salt. Add scent leaves or basil in the last 1–2 minutes
              of cooking — this preserves their aroma and color.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Serve:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Turn off heat. Serve the hot pepper soup into bowls, garnish with
              sliced onions and extra scent leaves. Serve immediately with
              boiled yam, plantain, white rice, or eat as a spicy broth.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3><u>Quick tips:</u></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Don’t overcook:
            <mark>Catfish becomes flaky fast — simmer gently.</mark>
          </li>

          <li>
            For a clearer soup: Don’t blend onions/peppers; add whole pepper and
            onion pieces or use chopped only.
          </li>

          <li>
            Heat control: Use fewer Scotch bonnets or remove seeds to reduce
            heat.
          </li>

          <li>Frozen fish: Defrost fully and pat dry before the lime wash.</li>

          <li>Leftovers: Keep refrigerated up to 48 hours; reheat gently.</li>
        </ul>
